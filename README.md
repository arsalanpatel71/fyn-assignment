This project is focused on developing a web application that provides weather forecasts by leveraging data from the external [OpenWeatherMap] API. Users can search for weather details for any location worldwide. Additionally, the application offers an automatic detection feature for the user's current location at startup, provided the user grants location access. 

Key features include caching weather data in both Redux store and session storage to minimize network requests, displaying maps for selected locations, and updating data synchronously to reflect the most current weather information. Users will enjoy interactive elements such as toast notifications for actions, a modal popup showcasing a seven-day weather forecast, and engaging zoom animations. The design is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across various screen sizes.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Caching weather information in both the Redux store and session storage to decrease reliance on network calls.
- Enabling users to find weather conditions by city name.
- Automatically identifying and using the user's present location to present weather data.
- Displaying a geographical map pinpointing the selected area.
- Regularly refreshing data to ensure the display of the most current weather statistics.
- Generating toast notifications for user interactions.
- Utilizing a modal dialog to offer an extended seven-day weather forecast.
- Incorporating dynamic zoom animations for an engaging user experience.
- Designed to be fully adaptable across a range of device sizes.
